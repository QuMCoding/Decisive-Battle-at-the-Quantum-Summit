{"question": "According to Planck's theory of energy quantization, why is it not easy to observe the phenomenon of discontinuous energy quantization in the macroscopic world? (A) The total energy of the system in the macroscopic world is too small, so it is not easy to observe (B) The energy quantization phenomenon only appears in the experiment of black body radiation (C) The energy of one quantum is small, so it is not easy to observe (D) Only the microscopic world It is in line with Planck's theory of energy quantization (E) The frequency of electromagnetic waves is too high, so it is not easy to observe energy discontinuities.", "answer": "The answer is (C)\n\nAccording to Planck's energy quantization theory, the energy of a quantum is hf. Since Planck's constant is about 10^(-34) J*s, the energy of a quantum is very small, and discontinuous changes in energy are difficult to observe."}
{"question": "The blackbody radiation spectrum can be explained by which of the following theories? (A) Huygens’ wave front theory (B) Einstein’s theory of relativity (C) Planck’s quantum theory (D) Maxwell’s electromagnetic radiation theory (E) Young’s double-slit interference theory", "answer": "The answer is (C)\n\nThe blackbody radiation spectrum must be explained using Planck's energy discontinuity."}
{"question": "The following are five electromagnetic wave sources. Which one has the spectrum closest to black body radiation? Hydrogen discharge tube: discontinuous spectral lines. Tungsten filament light bulb: Its spectrum is temperature-related and is a continuous spectrum. Blue light laser: Laser light with a wavelength between approximately 360 nanometers and 480 nanometers. FM radio: its wavelength is between 2.8 meters and 3.4 meters. X-ray: Its wavelength is between 0.01 nanometer and 1 nanometer. (A) Hydrogen discharge tube (B) Tungsten filament light bulb (C) Blue light laser (D) FM radio (E) X-ray.", "answer": "The answer is (B)\n\nBlackbody radiation is a kind of thermal radiation, which is a continuous electromagnetic wave spectrum radiated by the temperature of an object. Therefore, the electromagnetic waves emitted by tungsten filament light bulbs are a kind of blackbody radiation."}
{"question": "Which of the following statements about blackbody radiation is correct? (A) The so-called black body radiation refers to the study of the thermal radiation of a dark object (B) The radiation spectrum of black body radiation is related to the material (C) Anything that only absorbs and emits electromagnetic waves without reflecting electromagnetic waves can be called a black body (D) Black body radiation The intensity of radiation is related to the size of the object (E) Planck proposed quantum theory to solve the problem of black body radiation, which states that the energy of the electromagnetic oscillator is hv", "answer": "The answer is (C)\n\n(A) A black body is an ideal object. Under thermal equilibrium, it can absorb all external radiation and radiate the same energy to maintain the thermal equilibrium of the object. Objects that appear dark can still reflect electromagnetic waves and are not necessarily black bodies. A pitch black object does not necessarily meet the conditions of a black body. (B) (D) The spectrum of black body radiation has nothing to do with the material and size of the cavity, but is only related to the temperature. (E) It is the electromagnetic wave energy absorbed and radiated by the electromagnetic oscillator, not the energy of the electromagnetic oscillator itself."}
{"question": "It is known that the temperature of the sun's surface is about 6000 K, and the main wavelength of light radiated is 500 nanometers. According to the theory of black body radiation, the temperature of the black body is inversely proportional to the main wavelength of light radiated. Based on this calculation, how many centimeters (cm) is the main wavelength of the 3K cosmic background radiation? (A)0.01 (B)0.1 (C)1 (D)10 (E)100 cm.", "answer": "The answer is (B)\n\nAccording to the theory of blackbody radiation, Τλ_max is a fixed value, so 6000⋅500⋅10^(-9)=3×λ_\"3K\", so λ_\"3K\" =10^(-3) (m)=0.1 (\"cm\" )."}
